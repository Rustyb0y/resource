# PC Cooling

## Considerations when cooling your PC

1. Performance
2. Budget
3. Maintenance
4. Aesthetics

## Air Cooling vs AIO Cooling vs Custom Water Cooling

### 1. Air Cooling
- Lower cost
- Consistent cooling in hot environments
- Potentially increased noise

### 2. AIO Cooling
- Better case airflow
- Better Aesthetics
- Affected by ambient temperature
- lower noise

### 3. Custom Water Cooling
- Better performance
- Better quality pumps
- Better case airflow
- Higher cost
- Affected by ambient temperature
- lower noise

## Hard tubing vs Soft tubing

### Hard Tubing
Aesthetics > Budget = Maintenance > Performance

- Requires extra tools
- Increased cost
- Complex routing for best Aesthetics

### Soft Tubing
Budget = Maintenance > Performance > Aesthetics

- Optimal Routing
- Minimal Fittings
- Minimal Tools
- PVC or PUR
    - Can leach plasticizer into the loop
    - Can discolor over time
- EPDM 
    - Longer lifespan
    - Resistant to UV, ozone and heat exposure
    - Eliminates plasticizer leeching into the loop

## External vs Internal Radiators
Performance > Maintenance > Budget > Aesthetics

### Internal radiators
- Choice is limited based on your case
- More complex tube routing
- More maintenance time

### External radiator
- Takes up more space outside the case
- Less complex tube routing
- Better performance
- Option to downsize to a smaller case
- Fans are not required inside the case
- Easier to fill and drain
- Reuse the same radiator/tubing over many PC upgrades

## Distribution Blocks
Aesthetics > Maintenance > Performance > Budget

- Better Aesthetics
- Offers no performance improvement
- Much higher cost due to manufacturing process involved
- Potentially easier hard tube routing
- Minor improvement when maintaining the loop

## Advanced techniques
- CPU lapping
- Replacing CPU thermal compound
- Custom power cabling

## My Approach
Performance > Maintenance > Budget > Aesthetics

- Waterblocks
    - EK
- External Radiator
    - MORA3 for maximum performance
- Internal HEATKILLER Resevoir
    - Better use of space as I have heaps of room with the radiators/fans removed
    - Easier Mounting if I wanted to mount it externally to the MORA3
- DDC Pump
    - Save cost as it was one I already had
- EPDM Matte Black tubing
    - Cheaper and better for the long term
- EK Clear Coolant
    - Better for the long term, less maintenance
- EK Fittings
    - Convenience

Conversion Cost
- Sold internal radiators
- Sold my hard tube fittings and tools
- Repurposed fans
